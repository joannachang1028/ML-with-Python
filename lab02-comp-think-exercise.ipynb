    "**Q2** This is a question on functional abstraction.  When answering this question do NOT worry about efficiency.  The goal is to identify proper functional abstractions.  A **_balanced prime_** is defined as a prime number that is the average of the immediately preceding prime number and the immediately succeeding prime number.  i.e.,  if $P_n$ refers to the $n^{th}$ prime number then $P_n$ is a balanced prime if $P_n$ = $(P_{n-1} + P_{n+1})/2$.  For example `5` is a balanced prime since `5 = (3+7)/2`.  Write a function `isBalancedPrime(x)` which takes an arbitrary positive integer `x` and returns `True` or `False` as to whether `x` is a balanced prime or not.  While you do need to write a complete definition for `isBalancedPrime` you do not need to write the code for any helper functions.  Just give meaningful names indicating what they should do. "
